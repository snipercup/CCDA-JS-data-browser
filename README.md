# CCDA-JS-data-browser
 A browser-based tool to explore and analyse JSON data for cataclysm: Dark days ahead. The idea (which I took from CDDA-JS-itembrowser (see below) ) is that you drop the browser folder into your CDDA game directory and open the index.html from that folder and let the javascript do the rest. The javascript should be able to go up to the game directory of cdda and then down to data/json.



# Options considered:

## cdda-js-itembrowser-test
https://github.com/chuanyueyouxia/cdda-js-itembrowser-test.git
This is an outdated verstion of:
https://github.com/lispcoc/cdda-js-itembrowser.git
This is the most favorable example of an item browsers since it is in HTML/Javascript with little to no dependencies. The newer version does use some LUA, that is not desirable.

## cdda-edit
https://github.com/nornagon/cdda-edit.git
When installing the packages using NPM install, an error shows up stating python 2.7 is missing. An undesirable dependency.
